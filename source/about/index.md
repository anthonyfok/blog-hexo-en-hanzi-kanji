Hi, 

I am Yingjie Hu (Iris, or YJH), a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics in New York Unviersity. This website provides videos that compare Chinese Hanzi and Japanese Knaji. It is interesting to show similaries and difference between Chinese and Japense from historic perspective. I hope you will enjoy videos.
